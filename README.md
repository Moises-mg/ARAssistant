The project would consist of an Android application, through which we can manage  Augmented Reality glasses. 
In this application, we can include layers with descriptive  information and 3d element that will be superimposed on the user's environment

App developed on Android as a content server to Epson Moverio BT-350, service / s  to record data and to provide data to the application installed 
in Epson Moverio.  
Thanks to the positioning of the layers, the user can move freely and the elements  will appear by proximity, indicating tasks, descriptions, reminders, notifications etc.
